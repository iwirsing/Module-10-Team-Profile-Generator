# MODULE 10: Team Profile Generator
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

##  Description:

This program dynamically creates the html profile summary of a team from a user's input in the command line. This could consist of a manager, engineers and interns. The email input will be validated and there is also validation for the other prompts when the user does not enter any value as an input.

The HTML output will be responsive to media dimension, hovers on the profiles, opens an email draft when the email address is clicked and opens the Github link in a new tab when a Github link is clicked. An accompanying CSS file will also be created to make sure there will be a CSS file that goes with the index.html.
